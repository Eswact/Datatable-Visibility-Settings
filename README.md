This project provides a dynamic structure for configuring both sorting and visibility options for DataTables using plugins like DataTables and Sortable.js. Users can easily adjust these settings through a modal interface. When DataTables are used across multiple pages, this structure allows the creation and operation of a modal with just the DataTable instance and its associated tableColumns object. The solution streamlines the management of table settings across different pages.
